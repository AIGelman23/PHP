README – Make sure to first install PHPMyAdmin as localhost on either Windows or Macbook to be able to utilize this PHP file. About DBEntryForm.php – Enables the ability to pass values using standard html text fields that have been stylized using CSS. These values are passed using a function with $conn and $sql and inserted into a Database ContactDB under Table ‘Persons’ – the values entered into each of the fields are stripped over special characters and sanitized to make sure that a SQL injection attack does not occur. Purpose of this project: To show that I am capable of working with PHP as a language and implementing both front end design and back end design accordingly. Leaning towards full-stack development.
